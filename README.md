# Project-On-Advanced-Statistics-ANOVA-and-PCA
Two different datasets are provided for performing the ANOVA, PCA and inferences are given based on results.

# Overview
1. The first dataset contains the information about the salaries of different individuals based on educationcal qualification and profession. Educational qualification is at three levels, High school graduate, Bachelor, and Doctorate. Occupation is at four levels, Administrative and clerical, Sales, Professional or specialty, and Executive or managerial. A different number of observations are in each level of education â€“ occupation combination. An ANOVA(one-way and two-way) test is performed on dataset to interpret the business implications. 

2. The second dataset contains the information about various colleges and their enrollments to eduation post 12th Standard. The dataset tells about the numberof enrollments received by college, how many students actually end up taking education, students from out state, their accomodation information. Initially, EDA (Univariate and multivariate) analysis is performed on dataset to take note of inferences. As a pre-processing step, scaling is performed on dataset to bring it to same scale for better predeictions. PCA is performed on dataset to bring down the multi-collinearity, and better result prediction. For this dataset, PCA is 5 which shows maximum variance of dataset
